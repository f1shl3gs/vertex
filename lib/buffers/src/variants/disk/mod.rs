//! # Disk Buffer: Sequential File I/O Boogaloo.
//!
//! This disk buffer implementation is a departure from the LevelDB-based disk buffer
//! implementation, referred to internally as `disk` or `disk_v1`. It focuses on avoiding external
//! C/C++ dependencies, as well as optimizing itself for the job at hand to provide more consistent
//! in both throughput and latency.
//!
//! ## Design constraints
//!
//! These constraints, or more often, invariants, are the groundwork for ensuring that the design
//! can stay simple and understandable:
//! - data files do not exceed 128MB
//! - no more than 65,536 data files can exist at any given time
//! - buffer can grow to a maximum of ~8TB in total size (65k files * 128MB)
//! - all records are checksummed (CRC32C)
//! - all records are written sequentially/contiguously, and do not span over multiple data files
//! - writers create and write to data files, while readers read from and delete data files
//! - endianness of the files is based on the host system (we don't support loading the buffer files
//!   on a system with different endianness)
//!
//! ## On-disk layout
//!
//! At a high-level, records that are written end up in one of many underlying data files, while the
//! ledger file -- number of records, writer and reader positions, etc -- is stored in a separate
//! file. Data files function primarily with a "last process who touched it" ownership model: the
//! writer always creates new files, and the reader deletes files when they have been fully read.
//!
//! ### Record structure
//!
//! Records are packed together with a relatively simple pseudo-structure:
//!
//!   record:
//!     `record_len`: uint64
//!     `checksum`:   uint32(CRC32C of `record_id` + `payload`)
//!     `record_id`:  uint64
//!     `payload`:    uint8[]
//!
//! We say pseudo-structure because we serialize these records to disk using `rkyv`, a zero-copy
//! deserialization library which focuses on the speed of reading values by writing them to storage
//! in a way that allows them to be "deserialized" without any copies, which means the layout of
//! struct fields matches their in-memory representation rather than the intuitive, packed structure
//! we might expect to see if we wrote only the bytes needed for each field, without any extra
//! padding or alignment.
//!
//! This represents a small amount of extra space overhead per record, but is beneficial to us as we
//! avoid a more formal deserialization step, with scratch buffers and memory copies.
//!
//! ## Writing records
//!
//! Records are added to a data file sequentially, and contiguously, with no gaps or data alignment
//! adjustments, excluding the padding/alignment used by `rkyv` itself to allow for zero-copy
//! deserialization. This continues until adding another would exceed the configured data file size
//! limit. When this occurs, the current data file is flushed and synchronized to disk, and a new
//! data file will be open.
//!
//! If the number of data files open exceeds the maximum (65,536), or if the total data file size
//! limit is exceeded, the writer will wait until enough space has been freed such that the record
//! can be written. As data files are only deleted after being read entirely, this means that space
//! is recovered in increments of the target data file size, which is 128MB. Thus, the minimum size
//! for a buffer must be equal to or greater than the target size of a single data file.
//! Additionally, as data files are uniquely named based on an incrementing integer, of which will
//! wrap around at 65,536 (2^16), the maximum data file size in total for a given buffer is ~8TB (6
//! 5k files * 128MB).
//!
//! ## Reading records
//!
//! Due to the on-disk layout, reading records is an incredibly straight-forward progress: we open a
//! file, read it until there's no more data and we know the writer is done writing to the file, and
//! then we open the next one, and repeat the process.
//!
//! ## Deleting acknowledged records
//!
//! As the reader emits records, we cannot yet consider them fully processed until they are
//! acknowledged. The acknowledgement process is tied into the normal acknowledgement machinery, and
//! the reader collects and processes those acknowledgements incrementally as reads occur.
//!
//! When all records from a data file have been fully acknowledged, the data file is scheduled for
//! deletion. We only delete entire data files, rather than truncating them piecemeal, which reduces
//! the I/O burden of the buffer. This does mean, however, that a data file will stick around until
//! it's entirely processed. We compensate for this fact in the buffer configuration by adjusting
//! the logical buffer size based on when records are acknowledged, so that the writer can make
//! progress as records are acknowledged, even if the buffer is close to, or at the maximum buffer
//! size limit.
//!
//! ## Record ID generation, and its relation of events
//!
//! While the buffer talks a lot about writing "records", records are ostensibly a single event, or
//! collection of events. We manage the organization and grouping of events at at a higher level
//! (i.e. `EventArray`), but we're still required to confront this fact at the buffer layer. In
//! order to maintain as little extra metadata as possible as records, and within the ledger, we
//! encode the number of events in a buffer into the record ID. We do this by using the value
//! returned by `EventCount::event_count` on a per-record basis.
//!
//! For example, a fresh buffer starts at a record ID of 1 for the writer: that is, the next write
//! will start at 1. If we write a record that contains 10 events, we add that event count to the
//! record ID we started from, which gives us 11. The next record write will start at 11, and the
//! pattern continues going forward.
//!
//! The other reason we do this is to allow us to quickly and easily determine how many events exist
//! in a buffer. Since we have the invariant of knowing that record IDs are tied, in a way, to event
//! count, we can quickly and easily find the first and last unread record in the buffer, and do
//! simple subtraction to calculate how many events we have outstanding. While there is logic that
//! handles corrupted records, or other corner case errors, the core premise, and logic, follows
//! this pattern.
//!
//! We need to track our reader progress, both in the form of how much data we've read in this data
//! file, as well as the record ID. This is required not only for ensuring our general buffer
//! accounting (event count, buffer size, etc) is accurate, but also to be able to handle corrupted
//! records.
//!
//! We make sure to track enough information such that when we encounter a corrupted record, or if
//! we skip records due to missing data, we can figure out how many events we've dropped or lost,
//! and handle the necessary adjustments to the buffer accounting.
//!
//! ## Ledger structure
//!
//! Likewise, the ledger file consists of a simplified structure that is optimized for being shared
//! via a memory-mapped file interface between the writer and reader. Like the record structure, the
//! below is a pseudo-structure as we use `rkyv` for the ledger, and so the on-disk layout will be
//! slightly different:
//!
//!   buffer.db:
//!     writer next record ID:       uint64
//!     writer current data file ID: uint16
//!     reader current data file ID: uint16
//!     reader last record ID:       uint64
//!
//! As the disk buffer structure is meant to emulate a ring buffer, most of the bookkeeping resolves
//! around the writer and reader being able to quickly figure out where they left off. Record and
//! data file IDs are simply rolled over when they reach the maximum of their data type, and are
//! incremented monotonically as new data files are created, rather than trying to always allocate
//! from the lowest available ID.
//!
//! Additionally, record IDs are allocated in the same way: monotonic, sequential, and will wrap
//! when they reach the maximum value for the data type. For record IDs, however, this would mean
//! reaching 2^64, which will take a really, really, really long time.
