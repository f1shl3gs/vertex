/// A value that can be acknowledged.
///
/// This is used to define how many events should be acknowledged when this value has been
/// processed.  Since the value might be tied to a single event, or to multiple events, this
/// provides a generic mechanism for gathering the number of events to acknowledge.
pub trait Ackable {

/// A handle for acknowledging reads from a buffer.
///
/// In many cases, acknowledgements (sometimes referred to as "end-to-end acknowledgements") flow
/// with an event from the moment it is processed by a source, all the way until it is processed by
/// a sink.  This occurs with in-memory buffers, which are the default, as the `Event` object itself
/// which carries the acknowledgement state is never serialized or deserialized.
///
/// In other cases, such as disk buffers, the act of serializing the event to disk inherently strips
/// the acknowledgement data from the event that gets deserialized on the other side.  When an event
/// is written to a disk buffer, we acknowledge it after it has been written, which is where we know
/// that the event has been durably stored to disk and the source can propagate that acknowledgement
/// information as needed.
///
/// The other side of the equation is when we read events back out of the disk buffer and process
/// them in a sink.  Similar to if there was no disk buffer, we want the "source" -- which is the
/// disk buffer itself -- to know when it can remove the event from disk after it has been durably
/// processed by the downstream sink, and this is where `Acker` comes into play.
///
/// Any sink using a buffer is given an `Acker` that they use to update the acknowledgement state as
/// they process events.  Even when an in-memory buffer is used, `Acker` is still called, even
/// though it is a no-op.  In this sense, the `passthrough` variant represents buffers that do not
/// otherwise break the finalization logic when the event crosses into the buffer.
///
/// Conversely, `segmented` represents buffers where the acknowledgement logic is segmented into
/// multiple parts: the acknowledgement when being written to the buffer, and the secondary
/// acknowledgement when being processed by the sink after reading out of the buffer.
